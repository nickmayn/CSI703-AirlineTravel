# CSI703-AirlineTravel

## Data:

  - ADSB data pulled in from [opensky](https://opensky-network.org/) 
  - Airport locations pulled in from [icao data services](https://applications.icao.int/dataservices/)

## Approach:

  - Based on every flight pulled in from we generate a line where the opacity is the percentage of times the airline flies that flight.

## Result:

  - A streamlit app that contains the map visualizations.
